# Portfolio mk-2

![Portfolio presentation image](./src/assets/images/lake_mountain_view.jpg)

This application is my portfolio. In here, information about me and all projects I have done are present. 

## About my portfolio

This application illustrates what kind of person I am as well as what fields I specialize in and what I can do. But of course, this is only the portfolio at its earliest. In time, I plan to have different field sections the user can select to better sort the projects I make in the future. 

But enough about what will be done, now for the app itself. There are a few main sections the application currently contains: 
- About me: This part is simply about me and what I do.
- Projects: This part contains all the projects done so far.

## Build

This application is mainly build with the following js and css platforms:
- React

There are no other platforms or tools unrelated to react currently used.
